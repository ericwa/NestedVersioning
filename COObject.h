/** <init />
 * Initializes and returns a non-persistent object.
 *
 * The receiver can be made persistent later, by inserting it into an editing 
 * context with -becomePersistentInContext:rootObject:.<br />
 * Its identity will remain stable once persistency has been enabled, because 
 * this initializer gives a UUID to the object.
 *
 * You should use insertion methods provided by COEditingContext to create 
 * objects that are immediately persistent. Take note that these insertion 
 * methods use -init to initialize the object.
 *
 * For the initializer in subclasses, you must never create entity objects that 
 * correspond to relationships with insertion methods provided by 
 * COEditingContext (this ensures your subclasses support both immediate and 
 * late persistency with -becomePersistentInContext:rootObject:). For example, 
 * you must write:
 *
 * <example>
 * - (id)init
 * {
 *     SUPERINIT;
 *     // Don't instantiate the group with -[COEditingContext insertObjectWithEntityName:]
 *     personGroup = [[COGroup alloc] init];
