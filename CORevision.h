 * time and belong to a single root object and its inner objects. See

 * -changedObjectUUIDs and -valuesAndPropertiesForObjectUUID: can be used to 
 * retrieve the committed changes.

 * CORevision adopts the collection protocol and its content is a record 
 * collection where each CORecord represents a changed object whose properties 
 * are:
 *
 * <deflist>
 * <item>objectUUID</item><desc>The changed object UUID</desc>
 * <item>properties</item><desc>The properties changed in the object</desc>
