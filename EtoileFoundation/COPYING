Hi Uli,

I'm going to ask once again your approval for a license change. Would it be possible to change UKPluginsRegistry to a BSD license?
Currently it's under LGPL and EtoileFoundation which contains it is licensed under BSD.

The code is available here: <http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/etoile/trunk/Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation/Headers/UKPluginsRegistry.h?rev=4767&view=markup>
<http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/etoile/trunk/Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation/Source/UKPluginsRegistry.m?rev=4767&dir_pagestart=50&view=auto>

Sure. BSD is fine.

Cheers,
