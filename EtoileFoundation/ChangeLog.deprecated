	Support writing XML in a transactional manner.
	* EtoileXML/ETXMLWriter.h:
	* EtoileXML/ETXMLWriter.m: Added some synchronization mechanisms to
	ETXMLWriter and a private subclass that uses them. The -beginTransaction
	method can now be used to obtain a XML writer that writes well-formed
	XML transactionally.

2009-11-15 Niels Grewe <niels.grewe@halbordnung.de>

	* Headers/ETSocket.h:
	* Source/ETSocket.m: Added a -initWithFileHandle: initializer to

2009-10-22  Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Headers/runtime.h: Added a wrapper header which include the 
	Objective-C 2 runtime library functions, either from 
	objc/runtime.h on OS X or ObjectiveC2/runtime.h with the GNU runtime.
	

2009-09-25  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	EtoileFoundation now compiles on Solaris.
	* Source/NSFileManager+TempFile.m: Added a mkdtemp() implementation to

	(-value, -setValue:): Updated to retrieve the owner with
	-ownerObjectMirror.

2009-06-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New +[NSObject mutableClass] to simplify mutable class retrieval. This is 
	necessary to support Mac OS X and have all tests passed with Cocoa.
	With Cocoa, all collection classes are toll-free bridged with their 
	equivalent CoreFoundation types.
	The issue is that the instances returned by these collection classes always 
	use the mutable class variant as their superclass. e.g. NSCFDictionary which 
	is returned by NSDictionary (and also NSMutableDictionary) is a subclass of 
	NSMutableDictionary. The same holds for NSArray and other collection classes.
	Because of that, you have no way to conclude whether an instance is mutable 
	or not. There is no API in Foundation or CoreFoundation to check the 
	mutability.
	* Headers/NSObject+Model.h:
	* Source/NSObject+Model.m:
	* Headers/ETCollection.h:
	* Source/ETCollection.m:
	(+mutableClass): New method implemented by NSObject (dummy implementation) 
	and collection classes.
	* Headers/ETCollection+HOM.h:
	* Source/ETCollection+HOMMethods.m:
	(+mutableSubclass, -mutableSubclass): Removed.
	* Source/ETCollection+HOM.m:
	(ETHOMMappedCollectionWithBoIAsBlock, 
	ETHOMFilteredCollectionWithBoIAsBlock()): Updated to use +mutableClass 
	instead of -mutableSubclass.

2009-06-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Source/NSObject+HOM.m (-forwardInvocation:): Fixed invocation return 
	value on GNUstep. The return value is the target when the invocation 
	hasn't been invoked and not nil as with Cocoa.
	* GNUmakefile:
	* Source/GNUmakefile:
	* Headers/EtoileFoundation.h:
	Updated to include the new NSObject(HOM) related files.

2009-06-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/NSObject+HOM.h:
	* Source/NSObject+HOM.m:
	* Source/TestBasicHOM.m:
	Added.

2009-06-14  Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

  Fixed a bug in ETUTI which was causing Melodie to crash on startup.
  NSClassFromString will, in some cases, return private subclasses rather
  than the class you requested (e.g. NSClassFromString(@"NSImage") returns
  CLImage). I wasn't expecting this, and it introduced some inconsistency
  in the UTI database. Added a workaround which is a bit of a hack and should
  eventually be replaced with something better, when we have our new
  reflection API.

2009-05-09  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Made EUTI API a bit more consistent. Initializers or factory methods whose 
	last method keyword is 'supertypes:' were taking an array of UTI string 
	representations, when -supertypes returns an array of ETUTI objects. Now 
	'supertypes' in a method name always means an array of ETUTI objects, and 
	'supertypeStrings' an array of UTI string representations.
	* Headers/ETUTI.h:
	* Source/ETUTI.m:
	(+registerTypeWithString:description:supertypes:): Renamed 
	+registerTypeWithString:description:supertypeStrings:.
	(+transientTypeWithSupertypeStrings:, +transientTypeWithSupertypes:): 
	Renamed +transientTypeWithSupertypes: to +transientTypeWithSupertypeStrings: 
	and rewritten +transientTypeWithSupertypes: to have a new behavior.
	(-supertypes, -allSupertypes, -allSubtypes, -subtypes): Modified 
	documentation to make clear these methods that return UTIs won't return 
	string representations but ETUTI objects.
	* Source/TestUTI.m: Udpated.

2009-05-05  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/ETUI.h:
	* Source/ETUTI.m:
	Made ETUTI conforms to NSCopying, this way UTI objects can be used as keys 
	in dictionaries.

2009-01-21  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Source/NSObject+Etoile.m:
	(ETInstanceVariable -value, -setValue:): Fixed to check the type encoding 
	before trying to set or get the value. For example, this eliminates the 
	exception raised by -value with most C structures not supported by NSValue.
	-setValue: often results in a crash when I edit a text cell that calls it 
	with an NSString, no idea why for now... 

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Source/NSObject+Etoile.m:
	(ETInstanceVariable -value, -setValue:): Modified to support reading and 
	writing common primitive types in addition to objects, thanks to GNUstep KVC 
	related helper functions. Now does what the documentation states :-)

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/NSObject+Etoile.h:
	* Source/NSObject+Etoile.m:
	ETInstanceVariable
	Documented public methods.
	(-typeEncoding, -isObjectType, -properties): Added.
	(-typeName): Extracted the type encoding retrieval into the new method 
	-typeEncoding.

2009-01-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/NSObject+Etoile.h: Modified _ivar in ETInstanceVariable to 
	support NEXT_RUNTIME_2.
	* Source/NSObject+Etoile.m:
	(-instanceVariableForName:, -instanceVariableNames): 
	(ETInstanceVariable -name, -type, -value, -setValue:):
	Added NEXT_RUNTIME_2 support.

2008-11-21  GÃ¼nther Noack <guenther@unix-ag.uni-kl.de>

	* ETTranscript class added

2008-11-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* EtoileThread/README:
	* INSTALL: 
	Updated.
	* NEWS:
	* EtoileXML/README:
	Added.

2008-09-23  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/NSObject+Model.h:

	(-primitiveValueForKey:, -setPrimitiveValue:forKey:): Added.
	(-valueForProperty:, -setValue:forProperty:): Updated to use the new 
	methods.
	Also updated these methods in ETProperty class.

2008-09-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Added -hash to ETUUID. The hash function produces around 1 collisions for 
	100000 UUIDs.
	* GNUmakefile: Defined UKTEST_LONG for long testing.
	* Source/ETUUID.m (-hash): Added..
	* Source/TestUUID.m (-testHash): Added a new test for collisions between 
	UUID hashes.

2008-09-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Fixed UUID collisions on Linux by porting FreeBSD srandomdev() to it. If a 
	program is run several times, clock() returns relatively often an identical 
	value and with the low precision: 13000, 17000 etc. for example with ukrun 
	on my machine. This number is used as a seed, so identical sequences of 
	UUIDs can easily happen on Linux. This problem would also occur for multiple 
	programs that run concurrently and create UUIDs.
	* Source/ETUUID.m: Added ETSRandomDev() and modified INITRANDOM to use it if
	srandomdev() isn't available.
	* Source/TestUUID.m (-testString): Added a new test for collisions between 
	random sequences. Turned on collision test by default.

2008-07-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	+allSubclasses and +directSubclasses tested with EtoileUI on Mac OS X.
	* Headers/NSObject+Etoile.h:
	* Source/NSObject+Etoile.m:
	(+allSubclasses, +directSubclasses):
	Fixed this buggy code I wrote yesterday. My loop test was wrong and I wasn't
	taking in account the fact only NSObject root class implements 
	-isSubclassOfClass:, other root classes may not (for example Object).
	(ETGetSuperclass(), ETIsSubclassOfClass()): New private functions working
	as a little abstraction layer over GNU, NeXT 1 and 2 runtimes. Could be made 
	public in future.

2008-07-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Mac OS X backport.
	* Headers/EtoileCompatibility.h: Replaced an incorrect reference to 
	'EtoileUI' by 'EtoileFoundation'.
	* Headers/EtoileFoundation.h: Disabled problematic headers on Mac OS X.
	* Source/ETUUID.m: Modified to include GNUstep macros through 
	EtoileCompatibility.h.

2008-07-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/NSURL+Etoile.h:
	Removed AppKit import.

2008-06-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Source/ETGetOptionsDictionary.m: Fixed compilation on Ubuntu by declaring 
	optopt and optarg. Needs further investigation because getopt() is reported 
	as an implicit function and doesn't seem to appear by default in unistd.h
	as it should. Bug reported by kpropell on etoile-discuss.

2008-06-05  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx gmail>

	* UUID:
	  Update to 1.6.1 with Quentin's fix on uuid_dce_to_string (uuid_dce.c)

	* Source/ETObjectChain.m:
	* Source/ETFilter.m:
	(-initWithCollection:): Renamed -initWithObjects: to be more inline with 
	usual OpenStep terminology and avoid conflicts with the identically named 
	methods taking a variable number of args.
	(-_buildLinkedListWithCollection:): Renamed -_buildLinkedListWithObjects: 
	to match the previous change.

2008-04-23  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Source/ETUUID.m: 
	Replaced -release use by the RELEASE macro to be inline with the rest of 
	the framework code.
	(+UUID): New factory method.
	(-UUIDValue): Renamed -UUID to make clear the method returns a C value and 
	the distinction with -UUID that core objects implement.

2008-04-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/NSInvocation+Etoile.h:
	* Source/NSInvocation+Etoile.m:
	Added.
	* Headers/EtoileFoundation.h:
