This directory contains a set of classes which provide a better interface to POSIX threading routines than the standard NSThread.  The GNUmakefile will, on GNUstep platforms, compile the example tool and the documentation.  The Makefile will compile the example tool (but not the documentation) on Mac OS X.  If you use this on OS X and create an XCode project for building the framework, adding it to the tree would be appreciated.

This framework adds the ability to create objects in their own thread, and communicate with the asynchronously.  It adds a -threadedNew method to NSObject, which returns an instance of a class with its own thread.  Messages sent to this class are then forwarded to the other thread using a ring buffer.  Methods that return primitive types will block as normal, while methods that return objects or void will complete asynchronously.  Futures are implemented for object returns; a proxy object will be returned immediately, and any calls to methods on this proxy will block until the real object is returned.
