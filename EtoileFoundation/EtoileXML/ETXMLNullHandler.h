/**
 * The ETXMLNullHandler class serves two purposes.  First, it is used when
 * parsing to ignore an XML element and all of its children.  It simply 
 * maintains a count of the depth, and ignores everything passed to it.
 *
 * The second use is as a superclass for other XML parser delegates.  The class
 * implements the required functionality for a parser delegate, and so can be
 * easily extended through subclassing.
