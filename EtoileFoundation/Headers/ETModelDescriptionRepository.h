Each repository manages a closed model description graph. Model element 
descriptions present in a repository must only reference objects that belong to 
the same repository.

The repository resolves references to other element descriptions and checks the 
model description graph consistency, every time entity or package descriptions 
are added to it.

A main repository is created in every tool or application at launch time. 
Additional repositories can be created. For example, to store variations on the 
main repository data model.  */
