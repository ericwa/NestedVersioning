/** Abstract base class used by Model Description core classes. 

Also implements NestedElement and NamedElement protocols that exist in FAME/EMOF.

<chapter>
<heading>FAME and EtoileFoundation's Model Description</heading>

<section>
<heading>FAME Teminology Change Summary</heading>
Those changes were made to further simplify the FAME terminology which can get 
obscure since it overlaps with the host language object model, prevent any 
conflict with existing GNUstep/Cocoa API and reuse GNUstep/Cocoa naming habits.

We list the FAME term first, then its equivalent name in EtoileFoundation:
<deflist>
<item>FM3.Element</item><desc>ETModelElementDescription</desc>
<item>FM3.Class</item><desc>ETEntityDescription</desc>
<item>FM3.Property</item><desc>ETPropertyDescription</desc>
<item>FM3.RuntimeElement</item><desc>ETAdaptiveModelObject</desc>
<item>attributes (in Class)</item><desc>propertyDescriptions (in ETEntityDescription)</desc>
<item>allAttributes (in Class)</item><desc>allPropertyDescriptions (in ETEntityDescription)</desc>
<item>superclass (in Class)</item><desc>parent (in ETEntityDescription)</desc>
<item>class (in Property)</item><desc>owner (in ETPropertyDescription)</desc>
</deflist>
For the last point class vs owner, we can consider they have been merged into 
a single property in EtoileFoundation since they were redundant.
</section>

<section>
<heading>Additions to FAME</heading>
itemIdentifier has been added as a mean to get precise control over the UI 
generation with EtoileUI.
</section>

<heading>Removals to FAME/EMOF</heading>
NamedElement and NestedElement protocols don't exist explicitly.
