/** @group Viewpoints
@abstract A proxy giving access to a model property as a mutable collection.
 
ETCollectionViewpoint turns a collection property belonging to a represented 
object into a immutable or mutable collection proxy that implements the 
collection protocols.
 
Using it as an immutable collection proxy doesn't bring a lot of benefits. 
However ETCollectionViewpoint can use Key-Value-Coding accessors to support 
mutating the collection without implementing ETCollection and ETCollectionMutation 
on the represented object (for the property that holds the collection).<br />
A model object usually implements collection protocols providing access to its
dominant/main collection aspect, but the represent object doesn't support 
these protocols to access other collections exposed as properties. 
ETCollectionViewpoint exposes these other collections as the main collection is 
usually exposed. */
