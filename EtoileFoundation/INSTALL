EtoileFoundation INSTALL
========================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to
compile and use EtoileFoundation. The core packages are, at a minimum:

 * gnustep-make
 * gnustep-base
 * gnustep-gui
 * gnustep-back

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.


Build and Install
-----------------

Steps to build:

	make install


iOS support
-----------

For iOS, build the target named  **EtoileFoundation Library (iOS)** that belong to **EtoileFoundation-iOS.xcodeproj**.

To use the resulting library in your own project, the EtoileFoundation headers and library have to be made visible in the project search paths as explained below.

First, create a symbolic link inside your project directory (the one that contains the Xcode project) pointing on the EtoileFoundation directory :

	ln -s path/to/EtoileFoundation path/to/your/project

You must then tweak your project build setting $HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS (in the Search Paths section) to include the line below:

	$(PROJECT_DIR)/EtoileFoundation/build/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)

Finally link the library, and include the EtoileFoundation/Resources directory content among your project resources. You are now ready to use EtoileFoundation in your project by importing EtoileFoundation.h as you would usually:

	#import <EtoileFoundation/EtoileFoundation.h>
