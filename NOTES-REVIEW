// 1. user creates a photo montage, and drags in a vector graphic which was another persistent root.
// - the vector graphic can be modified externally without affecting the photo montage.

OK, make a persistent root copy when pasting a persistent root into another. (that would be the default. There would be a modifier for "paste link")

// - the photo montage can be branched and the vector graphic can be edited without affecting the original
//   branch of the photo montage.

This would require a recursive branch and recursive branch switch, but doable.

// - the vector graphic can be updated to the latest changes made outside the photo montage.

doable.

// - the montage can be reverted to an older version, which will also revert the vector graphic (when viewed
//   from within the photo montage - should not affect other branches or other documents where the vector graphic is embedded)

Not really doable.

// => the version of a persistent should encapsulate the versions of embedded persistent roots.

If that's the case, it should probably be pasted directly into the photo montage.
