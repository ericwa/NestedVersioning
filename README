The StoreBrowser app lets you experiment with this version
of NestedVersioning a.k.a ObjetMerging 5 a.k.a. CoreObject Prototype
(I know, the names are confusing.)

When you launch StoreBrowser, it deletes anything left over in
~/om5teststore/ and then creates an example repository there
using TestTagging.m.
