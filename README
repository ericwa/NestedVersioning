ObjectMerging / CoreObject rewrite
====================================

This is my work-in-progress rewrite of CoreObject.

Primary goals:
---------------
- Be a storage framework that could be used in a GNUstep/Cocoa app 
  which gives your app revision control for free. i.e., the app's document
  format would be an "object bundle" directory containing the document's
  history graph and all of the versions of objects (delta compressed
  for space efficiency).
  
- Similar spirit as CoreData, except adding revision control, and objects 
  don't need to follow a schema.


Changes vs. the original CoreObject implemenation:
--------------------------------------------------

- More restricted object contents: no serialization of existing ObjC objects;
 it is not possible to incorporate normal ObjC classes into the CoreObject
 graph. (you could use keyed archiving and then store the resulting
 NSData as a property of an object, though)
 
- Does not use message-based persistency

- Any multivalued property can contain COObjects

- My COObjectContext has a different role (it may be confusing to use the same name)

- (planned) full support for revision control features (diff, merge, branching)
 as well as selective undo.


Inspired by these papers:
--------------------------
- "Difference and Union of Models" by M. Alanen and I. Porres.
- "A flexible object merging framework" by J. P. Munson and P. Dewan.
 This paper has a lot of nice examples of collaboration scenarios with merging


Currently this is in a pretty early stage..
