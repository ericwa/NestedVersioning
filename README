The goal of NestedVersioning is a revision control system with the following features:

* Designed to be embedded in applications
    - For building applications with a persistent undo/redo stack, and capability for branching undo/redo
* Diff/merge on structured data
    - Rather than doing diff/merge on lines of text files
* Nested repositories
    - As in, what you would achieve by storing a git repository (the working copy and the .git directory) inside a mercurial repository, and committing to the hg repo after each commit to the git repo–the hg repo would provide a “safety net” allowing you to undo a version-control operation on the git repo that didn’t work out
