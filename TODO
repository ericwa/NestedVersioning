====

[x] (Nov 17/2011) rewrite store classes to use COStoreItem
[ ] (Nov 30/2011) investigate a lazy loading/faulting api, refactor editing context api
[ ] (dec 5)       search
[ ] (dec 5)       work on storebrowser
[ ] (dec 6)       make COStoreItem immutable. implement an efficient mutable t
                  by layering a diff together with an efficient immutable tree
                  this should be decoupled from the editing context code, and 
                  should become a thin wrapper around it.

last:

[ ] migrate to sqlite
