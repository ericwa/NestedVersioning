====

[ ] (Feb 5/2012)  refactor COPersistentRootEditingContext+PersistentRoots.h methods
[ ] (Feb 5/2012)  finish rewriting tests to use COSubtree
[ ] (Feb 5/2012)  write more tests? convert docs-only tests to code?

[x] (Nov 17/2011) rewrite store classes to use COStoreItem
[ ] (Nov 30/2011) investigate a lazy loading/faulting api, refactor editing context api
[ ] (dec 5)       search
[x] (dec 5)       work on storebrowser
[x] (dec 6)       make COStoreItem immutable. 
[ ] (dec 6)       implement an efficient mutable tree
                  by layering a diff together with an efficient immutable tree
                  this should be decoupled from the editing context code, and 
                  should become a thin wrapper around it.
[x] (dec 15)      fix up graph drawing
[wip] (dec 15)      port over merge code.
[ ] (dec 15)      come up with a way of representing merge conflicts
[x] (dec 15)      finally finish the mutable tree wrapper over COItem.
                  it should enforce the various validity constraints
				  (only one copy of a embedded item per tree, etc.), and
				  support joining trees (if they don't conflict),
				  detatching trees, moving subtrees. it should also be usable
				  standalone, with just COType and COItem classes. (no dependencies
				  on stores/persistent root editing context/ etc.)

[ ] migrate to sqlite
