 * The new context and store are retained objects (-dealloc releases them).
 *
 * Note that we create an autorelease pool. This is very deliberate - the nature
 * of the unit tests is that we open and close the database connection alot.
 * sqlite3 requires that all the prepared statements are "finalized" before the 
 * connection is closed. FM uses prepared statements to perform SQL queries, but 
 * it doesn't destroy them before returning - they are attached to the FMResult 
 * objects, which are autoreleased. This means that un-released FMStatement
 * instances are floating about, which means that in turn un-finalised prepared 
 * statements are around when we close the database. This sequence ensures that 
 * all the prepared statements are finalized before the database is closed. This 
 * problem is unlikely to occur in a real programme, as the DB connection is 
 * open for the entire programme length and probably controlled through a
 * ETApplication hook, where we could control the NSAutoreleasePool creation.
